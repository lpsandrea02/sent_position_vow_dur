# Sentence position on vowel duration

This is the research compendium for a group project on the effect of sentence position (medial, final) on vowel duration of word-final vowels in English. This repository contains a csv file <code>vow_length.csv</code> with all the data used in the project. After the assignment is graded, we can release an R Quarto project document containing all the code used for Bayesian and frequentist inference in our assignment.
